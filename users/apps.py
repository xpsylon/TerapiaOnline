In Django, the application registry is a central store of all available applications. Each application is represented by an instance of the `AppConfig` class. When Django starts, it imports each application in the `INSTALLED_APPS` setting, and it keeps track of them in the application registry.

The application registry being "fully populated" means that all applications have been loaded into the registry and are ready to be used. This includes setting up database models, readying the admin interface, preparing for handling requests, and more.

The `ready` method in `AppConfig` is a special method that Django calls once all applications have been loaded into the registry. This is a signal that the application setup process is complete and the application is ready to be used.

This is a good place to put application initialization code that you want to run once all applications are ready. For example, in your original code, the `ready` method is used to import the `signals` module from the 'users' application. This ensures that the signals are ready to be used as soon as the 'users' app is loaded.
